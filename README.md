# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Basic Rock-Paper-Scissors with Javascript

This is a small "Rock-Paper-Scissors" Project which gives output only on the console. The GUI will be updated later or on a separate repository.

With this I want to tackle the Javascript Fundamentals and learn how to solve a "real world" problem (as far as rock-paper-scissors go :slightly_smiling_face: )
